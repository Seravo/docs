Vagrant box contains plenty of helpers for developing your site and migrating data to/from production.

Production contains most of these and also a command for purging cache.

## List of commands

### Developer helpers
#### wp-list-env
```$ wp-list-env ``` - Prints list of defined environment variables. Both the Vagrant image and the production server contain ENVs which define ports and credentials for WordPress. With this command you can debug what settings you have.

#### wp-restart-nginx
```$ wp-restart-nginx``` - Restarts the web server and reloads any configuration at  ```/data/wordpress/nginx/*.conf```

#### wp-test
`$ wp-test` - Runs [Rspec tests]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2015-10-11-integration-tests %}) from ```/data/wordpress/tests/rspec/*.rb```


### Vagrant commands
> **Note:** These are only available inside the Vagrant box.

#### wp-ssh-production
```$ wp-ssh-production``` - If your config.yml is set up with production details you can ssh into your production instance.

#### wp-pull-production-db
`$ wp-pull-production-db` - Copies production database into your local Vagrant box. Also replaces all production siteurls in the database with your local development siteurl.


### Vagrant internal commands (good to know, but developers won't need to use these.)

  <strong>Note</strong>: These commands are used in <code>vagrantfile</code> by default.

#### wp-vagrant-activation
```$ wp-vagrant-activation ``` - Restarts nginx and avahi-daemon, generates domains in /etc/hosts and production details to .ssh/config

#### wp-vagrant-dump-db
```$ wp-vagrant-dump-db ``` - This is run everytime you `halt` or `destroy` the vagrant box. So that you have dump file next time.

#### wp-vagrant-import-db
```$ wp-vagrant-import-db ``` - This is run everytime you `up` the vagrant box.

It tries to import the dump file generated by ```$ wp-vagrant-dump-db``` so you can continue development where you left off.
